      <h3>Quote of the Day</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The beginning of love is to let those we love be perfectly themselves,
          the resolution not to twist them to fit our own image. If in loving
          them we do not love what they are, but only their potential likeness
          to ourselves, then we do not love them: we only love the reflection
          of ourselves we find in them.&rdquo;
          <cite>&mdash; Thomas Merton</cite>

        Exclusive: US government wiretapped former Trump campaign
        chariman (CNN)

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <mark>&ldquo;US investigators wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman
        Paul Manafort under secret court orders</mark> before and after the
        election, sources tell CNN, an extraordinary step involving a
        high-ranking campaign official now at the center of the Russia
        meddling probe.
      </p>
      <p>
        <mark>&ldquo;The government snooping continued into early this year,</mark>
        including a period when Manafort was known to talk to President
        Donald Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A secret order authorized by the court that handles the
        Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) began after Manafort
        became the subject of an FBI investigation that began in 2014.
        It centered on work done by a group of Washington consulting firms
        for Ukraine's former ruling party, the sources told CNN.&rdquo;
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <strong class="nick-note">Nick Note:</strong> This information was leaked on the
      same day the NY Times reported that federal agents raided the
      home of Manafort and told him that special counsel Mueller planned
      to indict him. While this investigation continues, President Trump
      will speak before the UN General Assembly today. Yesterday,
      President Trump had bilateral meetings with President Macron of
      France. Watch Mr. Trump’s remarks before the meeting. But today,
      his remarks reportedly will center on North Korea and Iran before
      the entire assembly. The world will be watching just like the
      Creator of the world is always watching. North Korea’s known human
      rights violations and Iran’s known desire to want to eliminate
      Israel have not escaped the all-knowing eye of the Lord
      (Hebrews 4:13).

        Hurricane Maria Does &lsquolMind Boggling&rsquo; Damage to
        Dominica, Leader Says (NY Times)
      </a>
    </h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The Caribbean island nation of Dominica sustained
        &lsquo;mind boggling&rsquo; damage from Hurricane Maria, its
        prime minister said on Tuesday, after the storm hit with maximum
        sustained winds of nearly 160 miles per hour that ripped
        roofs off buildings, including his own home.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There was no immediate word of deaths or injuries on
        the island from Maria, the third in a string of devastating
        hurricanes to sweep through the region in recent weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The National Hurricane Center said just after 5 a.m.
        that the storm, now moving away from Dominica, had regained
        Category 5 strength, after briefly dropping to Category 4.
        It is expected to remain “extremely dangerous” as it approaches
        the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Tuesday night and
        Wednesday, the center said.&rdquo;
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <strong class="nick-note">Nick Note:</strong> Would you consider pulling away to
      pray for those in the path of Maria? Specifically, I’m praying
      that God would protect people and compel helpers (2 Thessalonians
      3:3, 2 Corinthians 5:14)? John Bunyan is right: &ldquo;You have
      not lived today until you have done something for someone who
      can never repay you.&rdquo;

        Pediatricians may view tattoos, piercings as red flags.
        They should discuss it instead, report says (LA Times)
      </a>
    </h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Physicians who came across an inked symbol or a navel
        ring while examining an adolescent or young adult were taught
        to probe for other dangerous behaviors, including drug use,
        weapons carrying, risky sexual activity, and self-injury.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;On Monday, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued
        its first-ever clinical guidelines to members on tattooing,
        piercing and scarification in adolescents and young adults.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Body modification is quickly becoming commonplace, and
        the kids who engage in it are more than likely normal, healthy
        kids expressing themselves in ways that need not raise concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Tattooing and piercing of various body parts no
        longer is a high-risk population phenomenon, as evidenced by
        growing numbers of adults and adolescents not considered at
        risk who have tattoos and multiple ear and body
        piercings,&rdquo; says the new report.&rdquo;

      <strong class="nick-note">Nick Note:</strong> Do you have a tattoo? I have a
      birthmark, a few pimples, and a strong aversion to needles.
      Approximately 38 percent of millennials report having a tattoo.
      A 2016 poll found that 86 percent of adults who have gotten a
      tattoo don’t regret it. The Old Testament speaks to tattoos
      (Leviticus 19:28, Deuteronomy 14:2) but when considering the
      context, these verses appear to be addressing scarification
      (good luck measures). Should Christians get tattoos?
      &ldquo;Whatever you eat or drink, whatever you do, do all for
      the glory of God. (1 Corinthians 10:31)&rdquo;
